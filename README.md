Programs with this topics: Arrays and Sorting Algorithms/ Linear Data Structures/ Recursive Data Structures: Graphs and Trees

## Programs Included

This repository contains 4 mini programs in C++ demonstrating fundamental data structures and algorithms:

### 1. Array Operations (`array_operations.cpp`)
Demonstrates basic array operations including:
- Insertion of elements at specific positions
- Deletion of elements from specific positions
- Searching for elements
- Display of array contents

### 2. Bubble Sort (`bubble_sort.cpp`)
Implements the bubble sort algorithm with:
- Step-by-step visualization of each pass
- Swap operations display
- Efficient early termination when array is sorted

### 3. Stack Implementation (`stack_implementation.cpp`)
Array-based stack implementation featuring:
- Push and Pop operations
- Peek functionality
- Size checking and empty/full validation
- Display of all stack elements

### 4. Binary Search Tree (`binary_search_tree.cpp`)
Binary Search Tree implementation with:
- Insertion of nodes
- Three traversal methods (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Search functionality
- Recursive implementation

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Terminal or command prompt

### Compilation
To compile any program, use the following command:
```bash
g++ -o <output_name> <source_file.cpp>
```

Examples:
```bash
g++ -o array_operations array_operations.cpp
g++ -o bubble_sort bubble_sort.cpp
g++ -o stack_implementation stack_implementation.cpp
g++ -o binary_search_tree binary_search_tree.cpp
```

### Running the Programs
After compilation, run the programs with:
```bash
./<output_name>
```

Examples:
```bash
./array_operations
./bubble_sort
./stack_implementation
./binary_search_tree
```

## Program Features

All programs include:
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Input validation
- Clear output messages
- Error handling for edge cases

## Learning Objectives

- **Arrays**: Understanding contiguous memory allocation and operations
- **Sorting**: Learning comparison-based sorting algorithms
- **Linear Data Structures**: Understanding LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- **Tree Structures**: Understanding recursive data structures and tree traversal
